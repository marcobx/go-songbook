# Songbook
First of all my desire is to realize a laboratory to study Golang, the web authentication and other nice stuffs to produce a simple and secure web application.

Secondary, in front of you a shy attempt to realize a certainly "not new" idea: the thousandth songbook on the web!

Feel free to contribute with ideas and code, respecting the license agreement.

Enjoy!
